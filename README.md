> **AI-powered staffing forecasting for hotel F&B operations**  
> Semantic layer bridging external context (events, weather) with internal PMS data

---

## 🎯 Problem

Restaurant managers in hotels spend **5-8 hours/week** manually forecasting staffing needs with **~70% accuracy**, correlating data across siloed systems (PMS, event calendars, weather apps). This results in:
- Over/under-staffing → operational stress & revenue loss
- No integration between external context and internal operations
- Food waste from inaccurate demand predictions

---

## 💡 Solution

An **agentic AI system** that autonomously predicts staffing needs using:
- **RAG architecture** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for pattern-based forecasting
- **Semantic search** across historical scenarios to find similar operational contexts
- **PMS-agnostic design** compatible with any API-first system (Mews, Apaleo, etc.)
- **Human-in-the-loop** approach where managers approve predictions (augmented, not automated)

---

## ✨ Key Features

**🧠 Contextual Predictions**
- Combines external signals (city events, weather, holidays) with internal PMS historical data (occupancy, past demand)
- Qdrant vector search finds similar historical patterns
- Claude AI generates explainable reasoning

**🔍 Explainable AI**
- Every prediction shows WHY: "Based on 3 similar Saturday dinners with nearby concerts..."
- Confidence scores (85-90% typical)
- Pattern transparency for trust-building

**🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture**
- **Demand Predictor:** Forecasts covers using semantic pattern matching
- **Staff Recommender:** Calculates optimal staffing (servers, hosts, kitchen)
- **Reasoning Engine:** Generates human-readable explanations

**🔗 PMS-Agnostic Integration**
- API-first design works with any PMS (Mews, Apaleo, Opera, custom)
- No vendor lock-in
- RESTful endpoints for seamless integration

## 📈 Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1 — Backend API with mock patterns (BEFORE — done)

**Goal:** Ship a first end-to-end agent that can generate contextual staffing predictions from mock patterns.

Delivered:
- Multi-agent system (Demand Predictor, Staff Recommender, Reasoning Engine)
- Context-aware mock data generation (events, weather, holidays)
- Confidence scoring + explainable reasoning
- Integration test suite (7 scenarios)
- HuggingFace Spaces deployment

Timeline status:  
- **Before** → This phase moved the project from idea to a working backend with realistic mocked scenarios.

---

### ✅ Phase 2 — RAG Implementation with real patterns (BEFORE — done)

**Goal:** Replace mock patterns with real F&B behaviour extracted from hotel booking data.

Delivered:
- Kaggle Hotel Booking dataset processed (119K reservations → 495 F&B patterns)
- Qdrant vector database seeded with Mistral embeddings (1024 dim)
- Semantic similarity search powering predictions
- Validation tests passing on 4/4 core scenarios
- Live API deployed with real vector search

Technical details:
- Patterns derived from meal plans, day types, seasons, booking behaviour
- Cosine similarity scoring (typically 0.92–0.95)
- Safe fallback to mock data if Qdrant is unavailable

Timeline status:  
- **Before** → The agent now relies on real historical patterns instead of hard-coded mocks.

---

### 🔁 Phase 3 — Productisation & Observability (NOW)

**Goal:** Move from “cool API demo” to something that looks and behaves like a product F&B managers could trust.

Currently working on:
- Clarifying the F&B value story:
  - reframing outputs in business terms (labor hours, margin, guest experience)
- Designing the **manager-in-the-loop** workflow:
  - how managers approve, override, or comment on predictions
- Defining accuracy & impact metrics:
  - prediction vs actual covers
  - implications on staffing decisions
- Improving observability:
  - logging of predictions and explanations
  - tracking which historical patterns are retrieved for each decision

Timeline status:  
- **Now** → Focus is on credibility and usability for real hotel teams.

---

### 📋 Phase 4 — Dashboard & PMS Integrations (NEXT)

**Goal:** Build the first end-to-end experience that a hotel team could use day-to-day.

Planned next steps:
- Dashboard UI (Streamlit or Next.js) to:
  - visualize predictions vs actuals
  - inspect confidence scores and retrieved patterns
- Manager workflows:
  - approve / override staffing recommendations
  - log edits as feedback for the agent
- PMS-ready data model:
  - align entities with API-first systems like Mews and Apaleo
  - first experiments pulling real occupancy / reservations via PMS APIs
- Multi-property support for hotel groups

Timeline status:  
- **Next** → From infrastructure + API to a usable F&B operations tool.

---

### 🔮 Phase 5 — Agentic Operations Copilot (LATER)

**Goal:** Turn the F&B forecasting agent into a broader operations copilot for hospitality.

Longer-term ideas:
- Conversational interface (text + voice):
  - “What staffing do you recommend for Saturday dinner if the weather turns bad?”
  - “Show me services where we were overstaffed vs actual covers.”
- Proactive behaviour:
  - alerts for future under/over-staffed services vs historical norms
  - suggestions to adjust staffing or opening hours
- Extensions beyond F&B:
  - housekeeping workload forecasting
  - front desk peak prediction
  - simple, explainable agent workflows built on top of PMS APIs

Timeline status:  
- **Later** → Expanding a focused F&B agent into a general hospitality operations copilot.
