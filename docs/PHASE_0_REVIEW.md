## Validation Checklist

### 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT (`docs/Problem_Statement.md`)

#### Content Quality
- [ ] Problem described clearly (<3 phrases)
- [ ] Persona detailed (name, age, pain points realistic)
- [ ] Current workflow documented (step-by-step believable)
- [ ] Metrics quantified (time, accuracy, revenue impact)
- [ ] Success criteria defined (85%+ accuracy target)
- [ ] Why now rationale (AI costs dropping, labor shortage)
- [ ] Differentiation vs alternatives (3+ comparisons)

#### Validation Questions
**Q1:** Can you pitch problem in 30 seconds to non-technical friend?
- [ ] YES → Clear enough
- [ ] NO → Needs simplification

**Q2:** Would a restaurant manager recognize these pain points?
- [ ] YES → Realistic
- [ ] NO → Needs validation interviews

**Q3:** Are metrics believable (not over-optimistic)?
- [✅] YES → Credible and VALIDATED by industry research

**Validation:**
Research (Fourth, CloudFoodManager, Imperia SCM) confirms:
- Manual scheduling: 20-35% MAPE (65-80% accuracy) ✅ Our baseline 70% is mid-range
- Automated/AI: 8-18% MAPE (82-92% accuracy) ✅ Our target 85% is conservative
- Improvement: ~50% error reduction ✅ Our +15 points aligns with industry standard

Sources documented in Problem Statement Section 5.

**Status:** ⬜ NOT REVIEWED | ✅ APPROVED | ⚠️ NEEDS REVISION

**Notes:**
Quality should be fine enough for a MVP.
I need to make sure I am consistently adressing the right issue.

### 2. MVP SCOPE (`docs/MVP_SCOPE.md`)

✅ **Content Quality**
- [x] IN SCOPE limited to 5 features core
- [x] OUT OF SCOPE clearly documented (V2, V3, Enterprise)
- [x] Effort estimated realistically (23h coding + 20h setup = 43h total)
- [x] Features prioritized (P0, P1, P2 with rationale)
- [x] Decision framework defined (4 questions)
- [x] Constraints documented (technical, time, resource)

#### Validation Questions

**Q1:** Is scope achievable in 3 weeks part-time (15h/week)?
- [x] YES → Realistic timeline

**Justification:**
43h effort < 45h available (3 weeks × 15h/week). Buffer 2h (4.5%) pour imprévus.
Si risques multiples (Voice + Qdrant complexité), peut couper 1 feature P1 (Command Palette 4h).

**Q2:** Do features demonstrate core value (staffing prediction)?
- [x] YES → MVP focused on core value

**Analysis:**
P0 features (14h) deliver core value proposition:
- Prediction Display = Primary value visible
- Reasoning = Trust-building (explainable AI)  
- Approval Flow = Human-in-the-loop (augmented)

P1 features (9h) add differentiation but cuttable if needed. If time pressure → Can ship with P0 only (29h total).

**Q3:** Are OUT OF SCOPE items truly deferrable?
- [x] YES → Won't break MVP demo

**Validation:**
Ran mental demo scenario (manager opens → sees prediction → approves) = works without any OUT OF SCOPE features. Historical Accuracy Dashboard = only item worth reconsidering (trust-building), but can demo with mock data hardcoded if needed.

**Q4:** Discovery feedback incorporated (reasoning simplified, voice opt-in)?
- [x] YES → Adjusted based on research

**Evidence:**
All 5 discovery insights incorporated:
1. Reasoning simplified (1-line summary, collapsible)
2. Voice opt-in (floating button, not forced)
3. Command Palette secondary (menu fallback exists)
4. Approval Flow P0 (human-in-the-loop)
5. Explainability visible (reasoning transparent)

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

**Notes:**
MVP scope solidement défini et réaliste. 43h effort avec buffer 2h.
P0 features (14h) non-negotiable, P1 features (9h) cuttable si nécessaire.
Discovery feedback fully incorporated. Ready for Phase 1 implementation.

### 3. COST MODEL (`docs/Cost_Model.md` + Google Sheet)

#### Content Quality
- [✅] Monthly opex calculated per restaurant (<$10/month target)
- [✅] Development costs listed (one-time)
- [✅] Scale scenarios modeled (1 → 50 → 500 restaurants)
- [✅] Revenue model defined (Free/Pro/Team/Enterprise tiers)
- [✅] Unit economics profitable (Pro tier: 89% gross margin)
- [✅] Assumptions documented and realistic

#### Validation Questions
**Q1:** Is MVP cost sustainable for 1 restaurant demo ($5.30/month)?
- [x] YES → Affordable

**Breakdown:**
$5.30/month MVP cost < $10/month target ✅

Optimization potential: ElevenLabs free tier (10K chars) 
sufficient for demo (2,500 chars estimated). Could reduce 
to $0.30/month, but keeping $5.30 conservative estimate 
with Starter tier as safety buffer.

Zero infrastructure costs (Vercel, Render, Supabase, Qdrant, 
Redis, PredictHQ all on free tiers). Only paid service = 
Claude API ($0.30) + ElevenLabs ($5.00 or $0).

**Q2:** Do costs decrease with scale (economies of scale)?
- [x] YES → $5.30 → $1.14 per restaurant at 500 units

**Scale Economics:**
- 1 → 5 restaurants: -53% per unit ($5.30 → $2.50)
- 5 → 50 restaurants: -64% per unit ($2.50 → $1.88)
- 50 → 500 restaurants: -78% per unit ($1.88 → $1.14)

Drivers: Fixed costs amortized (Qdrant, backend hosting), 
volume discounts (Claude API bulk pricing), shared infrastructure 
efficiency (batch predictions).

At 500 restaurants: $568 total / 500 = $1.14/restaurant/month 
= strong unit economics for SaaS.
```

**Q3:** Is Pro tier pricing competitive ($49/month)?
- [x] YES → Mid-market positioning vs competitors

**Market Comparison:**
- 7shifts: $30-50/month (similar range)
- HotSchedules: $50-100/month (we're cheaper)
- Fourth: $75-150/month (we're cheaper)
- Toast: $69-165/month (we're cheaper)

Our $49 Pro tier = competitive on price, differentiated on:
1. AI reasoning (explainable vs basic forecasts)
2. Hospitality-specific (vs generic retail scheduling)
3. PMS integration (Mews/Apaleo native)

Positioning: "Premium but accessible" - not cheapest, but best AI quality for F&B.
```

**Q4:** Are AI API costs accurate (Claude, Qdrant, ElevenLabs)?
- [x] YES (avec correction Claude API)

**Verification:**
❌ Claude API: Original estimate $0.30/month → INCORRECT
   Correct calculation: $0.0165/prediction × 100 = $1.65/month
   
✅ Qdrant: Free tier <1GB confirmed (pricing page)
✅ ElevenLabs: Free 10K chars, Starter $5/month confirmed
✅ Supabase, Vercel, Render: Free tiers confirmed

**Corrected MVP Cost:**
- Claude API: $1.65/month (was $0.30)
- ElevenLabs: $5.00/month
- Others: $0
- **NEW TOTAL: $6.65/month** (vs $5.30 original)

Still <$10 target ✅ but need to update Cost_Model.md

### 4. FIGMA MOCKUPS (`docs/figma_reference.md` + GitHub)

✅ **Content Quality**
- [x] 4 core screens created (Dashboard, Prediction Detail, Voice Overlay, Patterns)
- [x] Workflow demonstrates value (prediction → reasoning → approval)
- [x] Design accessible and understandable (MVP quality OK)
- [x] Code generated via Figma Make (React + Vite)
- [x] GitHub repo documented for reference

#### Validation Questions

**Q1:** Do mockups show core value proposition clearly?
- [x] YES → Staffing prediction visible

**Evidence:**
All 4 screens demonstrate core value: Prediction (145 covers, 88% confidence), 
Reasoning (explainable AI), Approval workflow (human-in-the-loop), Voice input 
(differentiation). Mews PM will understand value proposition in <30 seconds.

**Q2:** Is workflow intuitive for non-technical manager?
- [x] YES → 4-5 clicks maximum, logical hierarchy

**Mental walkthrough:**
Dashboard → View Details → Approve = 3 clicks. Clear information hierarchy.
Minor improvement potential: "Reasoning" → "Why this prediction?" (less jargon).
Overall: Non-technical manager would understand in <2 minutes.

**Q3:** Are mockups "good enough" for Phase 0 validation?
- [x] YES → MVP quality, can polish in Phase 2

**Assessment:**
"Basique mais accessible et compréhensible" = perfect for concept validation.
Trade-off: Figma Make 20min (basic) vs manual 3h (polished) → Saved 2h40 for 
higher-priority backend work. Mews PM evaluates AI innovation, not design skills.

**Q4:** Code generated usable as Phase 2 starting point?
- [x] YES (as reference, not direct copy-paste)

**Strategy:**
Use as visual reference for rebuilding with Next.js 14 + shadcn/ui in Phase 1 
(6h already scoped). Figma Make code saved time in Phase 0 but not production-ready.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

**Notes:**
Mockups successfully validate core concept with minimal time investment (20 min). 
Quality sufficient for Phase 0 validation - not pixel-perfect but functional and 
understandable. Code generated serves as reference for Phase 1 rebuild with proper 
stack. No critical UX issues identified. Ready for demo to stakeholders.

**Status:** ⬜ NOT REVIEWED | ✅ APPROVED | ⚠️ NEEDS REVISION

**Notes:**
Reasoning and design need more work. 
Although it may be enough for a MVP.
Problem statement solide et validé par research industry. 
4 ajustements effectués:
1. Occupancy rate ajouté aux prediction inputs
2. Clarifié use case = ajustements fréquents
3. Metrics validés par benchmarks (Fourth, CloudFoodManager)
4. Sources documentées (MAPE 20-35% manual, 8-18% AI)

**Baseline 70% et target 85% sont CONSERVATEURS** 
(pourrions viser 88-90% avec optimization, mais 85% safe pour MVP).

---

### 5. ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`)

✅ **Content Quality**
- [x] System architecture diagram clear (Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ AI/ML)
- [x] Data flow documented end-to-end (9 steps, prediction request)
- [x] Technology stack justified (Claude vs Mistral, Qdrant vs Pinecone, etc.)
- [x] API specifications complete (3 endpoints with examples)
- [x] Integration strategy defined (Mews + Apaleo compatibility)
- [x] Data models documented (SQL schema + Qdrant collections)
- [x] Security & scalability addressed (MVP → 1000 restaurants path)
- [x] Architecture decisions explained (6 key decisions with rationale)
- [x] Agentic-first paradigm clarified (vs API-first infrastructure)

#### Validation Questions

**Q1:** Can a developer understand architecture in 10 minutes?
- [x] YES → Clear diagrams + explanations

**Evidence:**
10-minute readability test passed: TOC (2 min) + System diagram (3 min) + 
Data flow (3 min) + Tech stack (2 min) = complete understanding. ASCII 
diagrams functional. Could add Mermaid for visual polish in Phase 2.

**Q2:** Are technology choices defensible to Mews PM?
- [x] YES → Rationale provided for each choice

**Analysis:**
5/5 key decisions align with Mews priorities:
- Claude Sonnet 4: Reasoning quality over cost ✅
- Qdrant: Cost-conscious, fast performance ✅
- Voice opt-in: Research-backed decision ✅
- PMS-agnostic: Ecosystem strategy ✅
- Human-in-loop: Augmented not automated ✅

Section 10 documents rationale for all choices. Mews PM will recognize 
thoughtful trade-offs.

**Q3:** Does architecture scale (MVP → 100 restaurants)?
- [x] YES → Scalability path documented

**Milestones:**
- MVP → 10: Minimal changes (upgrade tiers) ✅
- 10 → 100: Horizontal scaling + caching (2-3 days) ✅
- 100 → 1,000: Microservices refactor (4-6 weeks, documented) ✅

Cost improves with scale: $6.65 → $1.22 (-82% at 100 restaurants). 
No architectural dead-ends. All bottlenecks solvable.

**Q4:** Is PMS integration strategy realistic (Mews + Apaleo)?
- [x] YES → APIs documented, effort estimated, backup exists

**Assessment:**
Mews: 7h integration effort, APIs confirmed, partnership required
Apaleo: 5h integration effort, sandbox FREE, no approval needed

Dual strategy: Primary (Mews) + Backup (Apaleo Store). Demonstrates 
interoperability = strength for enterprise. Both realistic 5-7h effort.

**Q5:** Agentic-first positioning clear?
- [x] YES → Distinct from API-first infrastructure

**Validation:**
Agentic layer (UX paradigm) vs API layer (infrastructure) clarified 
in Section 1. Terminology consistent throughout. Aligned with industry 
positioning (Mews Operations Agent, Apaleo AI-powered). Correction 
applied after research validation.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

**Notes:**
Architecture solidement documentée (12,000+ mots, 10 sections). Tous 
les choix technologiques justifiés avec rationale claire. Scalability 
path réaliste (MVP → 1,000 restaurants). PMS integration strategy 
défendable avec backup plan (Mews + Apaleo). Agentic-first paradigm 
clarifié vs API-first infrastructure. Ready pour présentation Mews PM.

**Q1:** Is structure ready for Phase 1 development?

Files are stubs (expected for Phase 0). Phase 1 will populate with 
actual code. No blockers to start backend development.

**Q2:** Are secrets protected (.env in .gitignore)?
- [x] YES → No API keys committed

**Verification:**
- .env in .gitignore ✅
- .env.example committed (template) ✅
- Git history clean (no secrets ever committed) ✅

Best practice: .env.example shows structure, actual .env created 
locally in Phase 1 with real API keys.

**Q3:** Is README clear for external viewers (Mews PM)?
- [x] YES → Explains project concisely

**30-second scan test:**
- Problem clear (5-8h → 2h, accuracy improvement) ✅
- Features visible (5 MVP features) ✅
- Tech stack listed (can evaluate choices) ✅
- Status transparent (Phase 0 progress) ✅
